            <p>The Nintendo Switch Lite is a long, rectangular gaming console that has a matte plastic finish and a reflective screen. The item itself has rounded corners and edges with slots at the top, bottom, and back of the game so it's well ventilated. It has an asymmetrical front consisting of 2 circular joysticks, a cross-shaped gamepad, 4 circular buttons reading X, A, B, and Y, a plus and minus button at the top next to the screen, and at the bottom of the console to the left and right of the screen is a square and circular button. The Nintendo Switch Lite is slightly heavy, weighing more than the average cellphone, and the back of this particular game is decorated in stickers. Although the front is a bit dusty, the gaming console is well protected with a clear silicone case and comfortable to hold.</p></div>
